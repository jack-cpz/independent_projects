Hi! My name is Peizheng (Jack) Chen and I am currently a graduate student at Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences majoring in Biostatistics and Data Science. I'm about to graduate this August. I am really into healthcare and pharmaceutical industries, as well as statistical analysis work.
